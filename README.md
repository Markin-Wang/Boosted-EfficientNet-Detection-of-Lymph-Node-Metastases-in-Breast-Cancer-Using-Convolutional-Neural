# Boosted-EfficientNet-Detection-of-Lymph-Node-Metastases-in-Breast-Cancer-Using-Convolutional-Neural
The official pytorch implementation of our paper "Boosted EfficientNet: Detection of Lymph Node Metastases in Breast Cancer Using Convolutional Neural Networks".[pdf](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/13/4/661)

## Requirements:
* Pytorch=1.6
* Torchvision
* Matplotlib
* Tqdm
* pandas
* sklearn

## Data:
Please download the data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data), and put them in the folder 'data'.

## Training and Testing"
```
python Bstd_EffNet.py
```
The model will be tested after each epoch during the training process.

Also, we will provide the code to test the model later.

## Plan
We intend to re-orgarnize the code.
