# Boosted-EfficientNet-Detection-of-Lymph-Node-Metastases-in-Breast-Cancer-Using-Convolutional-Neural
The official pytorch implementation of our paper "Boosted EfficientNet: Detection of Lymph Node Metastases in Breast Cancer Using Convolutional Neural Networks".
## Training and Testing
python Bstd_EffNet.py
The model will be tested after each epoch during the training process.
Also, we will provide the code to test the model later.

## Plan
We intend to re-orgarnize the code.
